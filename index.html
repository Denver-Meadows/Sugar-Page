        <h1>The Benefits of Sugar</h1>
        <p>While some dogs love to play with toys, Sugar loves to <strong>DESTROY</strong> her toys!!</p>
        <p>Sugar is currently looking for a new tennis club to join.  She has been kicked out of her previous 6 clubs for eating the balls
            during match play.  She has been banned for life but is issuing an appeal with the Cincinnati Tennis Organization.  
            We hope to have some positive news by this summer.

        <h2>Sugar's Rules For A Happy Life</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take Naps.  Lots of them.</li>
            <li>Eat as many treats as Mom will allow.</li>
            <li>Help roommates understand the bed is yours, not theirs.</li>
            <li>Only get out of bed for bacon or emergency trips to backyard.</li>
            <li>Tennis balls must die immediately.  They are rebel scum and must be dealt with ASAP.</li>
            <li>Double check that you destroyed all tennis balls.</li>
            <li>Any toys that squeak must have the squeaker removed immediately!  No exceptions.</li>
